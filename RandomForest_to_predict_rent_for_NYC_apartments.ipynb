    "\n",
    "- The main objective of this lab exercise is to create a model that can accurately predict rent prices for **typical** apartments in **New** **York** **City**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To prepare the data for modeling, a subset of columns is selected. The dataset initially was composed of 16 columns, out of which 11 columns were excluded from the modeling process. Among these exclusions, nine columns were of 'object' datatype, while the other two columns(num_desc_count, mgr_apt_count) were of 'numerical' datatype. These exclusions were made due to the lack of substantial evidence that they had any correlation with the 'rent price', which is our target avriable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Our model focuses solely on numerical features to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For the modeling process, five columns were selected based on their relevance and absence of missing values. Four of these columns (bathrooms, bedrooms, longitude, and latitude) serve as independent variables, while the price column represents the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Moving on, an initial model is created using the RandomForestRegressor. The code  iterates 10 times, creating random forest models with 100 estimators and using all available processors (`n_jobs=-1`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- The noised OOB score represents the model's performance when trained on the initial data, without any denoising or data cleaning. It gives an indication of the predictive capability of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The printed statement **\"Noised OOB score: 0.48\"** displays the average noised OOB score. This score is an important metric in evaluating the initial model's performance and provides insights into the amount of noise present in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Overall, the code accomplishes the objective of creating an initial model to predict rent prices for typical New York City apartments. The subsequent steps involve denoising and data cleaning to improve the model's accuracy and enhance its predictive capabilities."

This can be problematic because we are focusing on predicting rental prices for typical New York City apartments. If the data includes entries from other cities, it will introduce noise and bias to the model, leading to inaccurate predictions. | Filtered the data to include minimum value to longitude range of New York City i.e,<a href=\"https://bit.ly/43C9k1l\"> <b>Minimum longitude = -74.1502</b></a> | This ensures that the data is specific to New York City |\n",

    "| **Latitude** | Presence of non-New York City entries based on latitude values for NYC | Similar to the longitude issue, the dataset may contain entries from cities other than New York based on latitude coordinates. This poses a problem because the rental market in different cities can vary significantly. By filtering the data based on the latitude range of New York City, we can ensure that only entries from New York City are included, providing a more focused and accurate representation of the rental market in the city. | Filtered the data to include minimum value to longitude range of New York City i.e,<a href=\"https://bit.ly/43C9k1l\"> <b>Minimum latitude = 40.5795</b></a> | This ensures that the data is specific to New York City |\n",

    "| **Price** | Exclusion of **negative price** apartments | We have a few observations in our data with price values in negative range which is not possible. As we have no substantial reason behind wrong values in price we cannot fix it and hence, it will be better to remove them from training set of our model. | By filtering the data for prices above zero (0), we can remove all observations with negative price value. | This ensures that the data has all possible value for price of apartments. |\n",

    "| **Price** | Inputting a **maximum threshold** for price range | Some apartments have unusually high prices and as per our research, the maximum average price for 4 bedrooms apartment is approximatelty **USD14,000** and hence, going with the available resources, we will also be setting a maximum threshold to price | Filtered the data to implement a maximum range to price i.e,<a href=\"https://bit.ly/3N7UmJZ\"> <b>Maximum Price = USD14,000</b></a> | This ensures that the data represents typical New York City apartment prices |\n",
    "| **Bedrooms** | Exclusion of apartments with excessive bedrooms | According to market resource, any typical New York city apartment consists of **maximum 4 bedrooms apartment** and anything above that is not considered as an apartment and hence, going with the mentioned resource, we will be removing all bedrooms above 4. | Filtered the data to implement a maximum range to bedrooms i.e, <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3N7UmJZ\"> <b>Bedrooms >=4 </b></a> | This aligns with the typical number of bedrooms in New York City apartments |\n",
    "| **Bathrooms** | Exclusion of **zero (0) Bathrooms** | Typical apartments generally don't have zero bathrooms or in simpler terms, all apartment have a specific number of bathrooms.
